7. **HTML in Python** - String concatenation for pages
8. **No Templating** - Manual HTML generation
9. **No MVC Pattern** - Chaotic structure

### Database Issues

10. **No ORM** - Raw SQL everywhere
11. **No Connection Pooling** - New connection per request
12. **Hardcoded Paths** - Database location fixed
13. **N+1 Queries** - Performance problems

### Code Quality

14. **Giant Functions** - 200+ line functions

17. **No Logging** - Console.log only
18. **Repetitive Code** - DRY violations
19. **No Tests** - Zero test coverage

### Frontend Issues

20. **Alert/Prompt UI** - Poor user experience
21. **Inline Event Handlers** - Security risks
